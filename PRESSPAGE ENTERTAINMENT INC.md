W Autarky Business Model
PressPage Entertainment Inc uses the autarky business model which stems from self-sufficincy.

The need for this business model becomes more apparent during the 202 COVID shutdown when the supply chain waas distrupted. Additionally, Big Tech with their planned obsolescense prompted the needed for the autarky business model.

The autarky business model is achieved through the creation of child business entities known as DBA's. Each DBA has a budget and unique purpose that benefites the organization as a whole.
